# Tumble
Behold the repository for my very first mobile application. If all else fails, I'll
be making a YouTube clone for coding-specific tutorials. Keep up-to-date with my stumbling
via my [Medium profile](https://medium.com/@gracehartzell_41523).
TL;DR: Tumble is a dating-like app to connect people with great ideas to people who can bring
those ideas come to life. 

### Name-spiration
Tumble was stumbled upon from three different aspects:
1. Reminiscing about previous visits to a similarly named food truck that has 
delicious fried chicken. 
2. Been feeling a little like I'm tumbling through life.
3. Thought of it as a dating app and since Bumble is named Bumble, I did a play on words.
Then I found out that Bumble has a section for networking... So Tumble is a tumble from
Bumble's mumbles.

### Purpose
There are a few different types of people when it comes to project making: 
1. **The idea maker**: this person thrives on creativity and sometimes keeps a journal of 
all of their brilliant ideas.
2. **The creator**: this person doesn't necessarily have the creative ideas but does have the 
ability to bring things to life. 

The purpose of Tumble is to create a resource for both of these people to bring them together
so that great ideas can be realized in the world!
